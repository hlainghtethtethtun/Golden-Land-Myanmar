                <p>
                  Religion is an essential aspect of life in Myanmar and central to conceptions of personal identity. Most of the Burmese population identify as Buddhist (87.9%). However, there are also significant minorities of Christians (6.2%) and Muslims (4.3%), as well as some Animists (0.8%) and Hindus (0.5%). Generally speaking, one's religious identity is related to ethnic origins. Most Bamar are Buddhist while people belonging to minority religions are usually from minority ethnic groups. Christianity is dominant among the Kachin, Chin and Naga ethnic groups. It is also practised widely among the Karen and Karenni ethnic groups, although many Karen and Karenni are Buddhist and some Karen are Animist or Muslim. Islam is widely practised among ethnic Indians, the Kaman and Rohingya as well as some Bamar.

                  Buddhism is deeply embedded in Burmese culture and has become associated with the national identity of the Bamar. The prominent form of Buddhism practised in Myanmar is Theravāda Buddhism. Followers of Theravāda Buddhism take refuge in the 'Triple Gem': the teacher (Buddha), the teaching (dharma) and the monastic community (the Sangha). These three elements of Buddhism provide a sense of stability within Burmese society by offering a structure for people to base their everyday routines around.

              <div class="col-12 col-md-4">
                <p>
                  The architecture of Myanmar, in Southeast Asia, includes architectural styles which reflect the influence of neighboring and Western nations and modernization. The country's most prominent buildings include Buddhist pagodas, stupas and temples, British colonial buildings, and modern renovations and structures. Myanmar's traditional architecture is primarily used for worship, pilgrimage, storage of Buddhist relics, political activism and tourism.

                  Traditional Myanmar architecture is accomplished and artistic. Myanmar is a country of zedi (stupas), often called 'pagodas' in English. Wherever you are - boating down the river, driving through the hills, even flying above the plains - there always seems to be a hilltop zedi in view. Bagan (Pagan) is the most dramatic result of this fervour for religious monuments - an enthusiasm that continues today, as the mass rebuilding of temples at the site attests.
                  Art and the arts are a cornerstone of Myanmar culture. Many fine examples of local painting, lacquerware, pottery and more can be found at markets all around the country, and Yangon has a burgeoning art scene.

                  The arts in Myanmar are also strongly aligned with their conservative Buddhist way of life. Paintings and sculptures showing the life and teachings of Gautama are common, especially in the ancient temples of Bagan. This was once painted or carved directly into the stone. When paper was introduced to the country, the art and paintings related to religious beliefs became more elaborate and expressive.Early Myanmar art was always a part of the religious architecture - paints were for the walls of temples, sculpture to be placed inside them.

Many fine examples of local painting, lacquerware, pottery and more can be found at markets all around the country, and Yangon has a burgeoning art scene. Many pieces, formerly in paya or kyaung (Burmese Buddhist monasteries), have been sold or stolen and, unfortunately, you'll easily find more Myanmar religious sculpture for sale or on display overseas than in Myanmar.

                  The typical garment of the Burmese is the Indian lungi or longyi, a sarong worn by both men and women. This replaced the traditional paso for men and tamein for women by the 20th century. For business and formal occasions, Bamar men wear a Manchu Chinese jacket over an English collar shirt (sometimes donning a turban called gaung baung), while Bamar women wear a blouse buttoned at the front, called yinzi or to the side, called yinbon, and a shawl. In urban areas, skirts and pants are becoming more common, particularly among the young.
                  Longyi is one of the most iconic and traditional forms of dress in Myanmar. It is a piece of cloth that is sewn into a cylindrical shape and tucked at the waist. It is worn by both men and women, with slight variations of the garment for each gender. Most of the men will call their garment a “pasu” while women call theirs “htamein”.

                  During the British colonial era, Burmese nationalists associated traditional clothing, in particular Yaw longyi, a type of longyi from the Yaw region, and pinni taikpon, a fawn-coloured collarless jacket, with anti-colonialism and nationalist sentiment, because of a clampdown in the 1920s over increasing dissent.[11] Wearing "traditional" clothing was seen as a mode of passive resistance among the Burmese.[11] British rule nonetheless influenced hair fashion and clothing. Cropped short hair, called bo ke replaced long hair as the norm among Burmese men.

                  There are twelve months in the traditional Burmese calendar and twelve corresponding festivals. Most of the festivals are related to Burmese Buddhism and in any town or village the local paya pwè (the pagoda festival) is the most important one.
                  The most well-known festival is Thingyan, a four-day celebration of the coming Lunar New Year. This festival is held prior to the Burmese New Year, the first day of Tagu which falls in mid-April. It is related and similar to other Southeast Asian New Year festivals (Songkran, Cambodian New Year, Sinhalese New Year and Lao New Year), people splash water on one another. However, Thingyan has religious significance, marking the days in which Buddhists are expected to observe the Eight Precepts of Buddhism.

                <p>
                  It is a Buddhist festival celebrated over a period of four to five days, culminating in the New Year. The dates of the Thingyan Festival are calculated according to the Burmese calendar. The dates of the festival are observed as public holidays throughout Myanmar, and are part of the summer holidays at the end of the school year. Water-throwing or dousing one another from any shape or form of vessel or device that delivers water is the distinguishing feature of this festival and may be done on the first four days of the festival. The New Year takes place at virtually the same time as the new year celebrations of many countries in South Asia like China (Dai People of Yunnan Province), Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Nepal, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka.

                  The Thadingyut Festival , also known as the Lighting Festival of Myanmar, is held on the full moon day of the Burmese lunar month of Thadingyut. As a custom, it is held at the end of the Buddhist sabbath (Vassa) and is the second most popular festival in Myanmar after Thingyan Festival (New Year Water Festival). Thadingyut festival is the celebration to welcome the Buddha's descent from the heaven after he preached the Abhidhamma to his mother, Maya, who was reborn in the heaven.

                  During the festival days, Buddhists usually go to pagodas and monasteries to pay respect to the monks and offer foods. And some Buddhists usually fast on the full moon day. Young people usually pay respect (gadaw) to their parents, teachers, and elderly relative and offer them some fruits and other gifts. Also while paying homage the younger people usually ask for forgiveness from the wrong-doings they have caused upon their parents or the other elderly relatives throughout the year. Traditionally the elders tell their youngsters that they forgive any of their wrongdoings and continue to bless them with good luck and gift some big notes as pocket money. It is also usual for younger siblings to pay homage to their older siblings. In return, the elder ones wish good luck for them and give them some pocket money.

                  Thanakha is a unique traditional makeup and essential of Burmese people for their daily life. Thanakha is derived from the finely ground bark of the Thanakha tree.  Burmese people grind the tree bark against a flat and wet circular smooth stone then put the paste on the face and make the circle on the cheek. Thanakha paste has slightly yellowish color with the little silky texture and the pleasant smell of tree bark. Burmese people have been wearing Thanaka on their faces every day throughout the country for many centuries.
                  Most of the East-South Asian countries, even Myanmar are located in the tropical zone, the temperature remains relatively constant (hot) throughout the year.However, their skin is always firm, smooth and rarely acne. The secret to this is that instead of using some kinds of chemical cosmetics, they regularly use Thanakha power.

                  Thanakha is a natural cosmetic that you can only see in Myanmar. Thanaka bark is highly antioxidant, vitamin E and absorbs UV rays which protect our skin against free radicals and polluted air. It’s also protected from the sun, lightening of the skin. When you put Thanakha on your face, you will feel very cool on your skin. Burmese people wear Thanakha during the day for sun protection and after taking a bath or wash face at night to cleanse, nourish and calm the skins with its rich and natural ingredients. Thanakha can also prevent oiliness, spots, acne and keeps the skin smooth. Myanmar people use Thanakha daily from the kids to smooth their faces when they grow up. In the village, the farmer and women wear Thanakha on the face and also arms and legs to protect the sunlight for the whole day when they go to the farm.
